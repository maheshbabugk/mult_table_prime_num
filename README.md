Program that prints out a multiplication table of the first 10 prime numbers. 

The program must run from the command line and print to screen one table.   
Across the top and down the left side should be the 10 primes, and the body of the table should contain the product of multiplying these numbers. 

Notes:   
   
Consider code readability/complexity   
Consider cases where we want more than ‘10’ primes   
Consider KISS and not over-engineering   
Consider re-usability   
Write your own implementation for generating prime numbers (DO NOT use a library)  
Write tests  
Write it in PHP
